# 2player-game
2 player game using dice roll. Implemented using html, css and javascript.

This is known as a pig game. So, two players will roll the dice, and the dice number will be added to their current score for that round. If they roll a '1', the active player is switched and all their current score for that round is terminated. After rolling the dice one time, they then have two options- to hold their score and add it to their overall top score, or risk it and try for another roll. The player who reaches 100 points first wins.
